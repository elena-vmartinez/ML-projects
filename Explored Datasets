Three datasets explored:

#1 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sk4467/email-ctr-prediction
Includes:
- Subject length
- Body length
- Day of week sent
- Time sent
Potential to predict click rate based on these factors.

#2 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balaka18/email-spam-classification-dataset-csv
Randomly picked email files and their respective labels for spam or not-spam classification. Includes relative email spam stats, but irrelevant to email CTR.

#3 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohinurabdurahimova/maildataset
Emails and the text in them. Potential to predict spam. Irrelevant to CTR.

OKAY I WAS GOING TO GO INTO THE DIRECTION OF MARKETING but this instead has peaked my interest in the realm of cybersecurity.

(POTENTIAL) CHOSEN OPTION #4
Microsoft Security Incident Prediction Dataset - Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Microsoft/microsoft-security-incident-prediction/data
SIZE: 538MB 
"Contains over 13 million pieces of evidence across 33 entity types, covering 1.6 million alerts and 1 million annotated incidents with triage labels from 
customers over a two-week period...We provide three hierarchies of data: (1) evidence, (2) alert, and (3) incident. At the bottom level, evidence supports an alert. 
For example, an alert may be associated with multiple pieces of evidence such as an IP address, email, and user details, each containing specific supporting metadata. 
Above that, we have alerts that consolidate multiple pieces of evidence to signify a potential security incident."
